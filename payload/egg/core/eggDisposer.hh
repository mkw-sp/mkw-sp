//! Scene-specific, heap-allocated resources in mkw are typically not explicitly
//! freed. This isn't a memory leak, though: when a Scene transitions, all
//! memory allocated within it is returned in one block. However, in C++, the
//! destructor of an object must be called when its lifetime
//! expires--otherwise, we could leak second-order resources and introduce
//! use-after-free bugs.
//!
//! Disposer solves this issue: when a heap is destroyed,
//! the linked list of dispoers is traversed and each destructor is called
//! in-order.
